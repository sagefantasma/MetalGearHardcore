# What is METAL GEAR: Hardcore?
METAL GEAR: Hardcore is a (soon to be) series of gameplay mods designed to modify the standard METAL GEAR gameplay experience. Some of the options serve to significantly increase difficulty, some serve to simply mix things up. Right now, **METAL GEAR: Hardcore is only available for MGS2**, but there are plans to also implement this for MGS3, and hopefully MGS1 later down the line.
